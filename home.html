  <h2> Miranda's Story  </h2>
 <center> <p> Miranda was going to get ice cream with her mom and dad. They were crossing the street when a drunk driver hit Miranda and her parents. Miranda woke up in the hospital scared and alone. She started crying and screaming for her parents. Doctors came rushing in after they heard her scream. A social worker came to Miranda's room and comforted her in her time of need. She was told both her parents passed away in the collision. She would have to be put in the foster care system. After two years and many foster homes, Miranda was finally adopted and put into a loving home. </p></center>
